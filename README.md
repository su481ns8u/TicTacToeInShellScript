Hello this is Sudhanshu and this is the simple tic tac toe game created for the fulfillment of assignment work at BridgeLabz

Following are some notable points:
1. In this project player plays against computer.
2. The computer has given the functionality to think as a user.
3. There is an alternative function given for checkWin() function
   The second checkWin() function does increments, uses loops and checks conditions for multiple times
   which gradually increases the time consumption so as per the first function I have used Hard Coded values.
